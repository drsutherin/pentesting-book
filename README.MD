#Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction
by Georgia Weidman

This repo is just a reference of the files that I've created while working through Georgia Weidman's introductory pentesting book.  It's not particularly well-organized, but I just wanted to have something out there showing what I'm working on.
